### Portfolio for CIS 111 Introduction to Web Progamming

In the Spring of 2021, I took [CIS 111 at College of San Mateo](http://catalog.collegeofsanmateo.edu/current/courses/computer-and-information-science/cis-111.php). This repo is a final portfolio for all of my projects during the semester, as requested by my professor. 

In regards to [aboutme.html](https://github.com/jacobvillorente/jacobvillorente/blob/main/aboutme.html):
- I graduated from Ca√±ada College in December of 2022 with an Associates in Psychology
- I'm no longer a psych major
- I don't like hiking. Why did I put that?
